h2. Preferences/options

Plugin prefs can be set under the "Admin > Preferences":?event=prefs#prefs_group_oui_player tab and are mainly used as default values for the @<txp:oui_player />@ tag attributes.

While %(information)some player parameters, related to the item to play, should be used through attributes% (e.g. the Youtube @start@ parameter which define the second where to start playing the video), %(information)these used as global settings should preferrably be set through the plugin preferences% to %(warning)avoid a massive use of tag attributes%.

Of course, it is still possible to override a plugin pref value via an attribute when needed.
