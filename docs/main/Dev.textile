h2. For Developpers

h3. Using plugin classes and methods

This plugin allow developers to easily embed configurable players directly via PHP.
For more informations, these two main plugin classes should be considered: Oui\Player\Main and Oui\Player\Provider.

h3. Txp tags use vs PHP examples

h4. Display a player if the provided URL is recognised as a provider URL scheme

bc(language-markup).. <txp:oui_if_player play="https://vimeo.com/186406583">
    <txp:oui_player />
</txp:oui_if_player>

p. This can be achieve with the following PHP code.

bc(language-php).. $class = 'Oui\Player\Main';
$obj = $class::getInstance();
$obj->play = "https://vimeo.com/186406583";

if ($obj->checkUrl()) {
    echo $obj->getPlayer();
}

h4. Display a Vimeo customized player

bc(language-markup).. <txp:oui_player provider="Vimeo" play="186406583" width="480" autoplay="1" />

p. The tag above can be replaced by the few following lines of PHP.

bc(language-php).. $class = 'Oui\Player\Vimeo';
$obj = $class::getInstance();
$obj->play = "186406583";
$obj->config = array(
    'width'     => '480',
    'autoplay' => '1',
);

echo $obj->getPlayer();

h3. Extending

This plugin was designed to make it easily extendable.
For more informations, take a look at the @Oui\Player\Provider@ class which is the parent class of each provider class.
