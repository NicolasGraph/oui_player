h3. Using plugin classes and methods

This plugin allow developers to easily embed configurable players directly via PHP.
For more informations, these two main plugin classes should be considered: @Oui\Player\Main@ and @Oui\Player\Provider@.

h3. Txp tags use vs PHP examples

h4. Display a player if the provided URL is recognised as a provider URL scheme

bc(language-markup).. <txp:oui_if_player play="https://vimeo.com/186406583">
    <txp:oui_player />
</txp:oui_if_player>

p. This can be achieve with the following PHP code.

bc(language-php).. $obj = Oui\Player\Main::getInstance("https://vimeo.com/186406583");

echo $obj->getInfos(false) ? $obj->getPlayer() : 'Nothing to see here.';

h4. Display a Vimeo customized player

bc(language-markup).. <txp:oui_player provider="Vimeo" play="186406583" width="480" autoplay="1" />

p. The tag above can be replaced by the few following lines of PHP.

bc(language-php). echo Oui\Player\Vimeo::getInstance("186406583", array('width'  => '480', 'autoplay' => '1'))->getPlayer();

h3. Extending

This plugin was designed to make it easily extendable.
For more informations, take a look at the @Oui\Player\Provider@ class which is the parent class of each provider class.
