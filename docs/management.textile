h3. Download and customization

h4. Recommended advanced install

It is recommended to customize the plugin by removing providers you don't need to support and ordering the ones you want to keep from the more often used to the less one.
These two actions would increase avoid to install useless code and would increase the plugin performances, mainly when the provider is not defined by you.

# "Download":https://github.com/NicolasGraph/oui_player/releases a _Source code_ package;
# Edit the _manifest.json_ file;
# Use "MassPlugCompiler":https://github.com/NicolasGraph/MassPlugCompiler to compile your custom plugin.
