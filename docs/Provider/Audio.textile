* comma separated list of *URL's* using one of the following extensions: @.mp3@, @.ogg@, @.oga@, @.wav@, @aac@ or @.flac@.

When using the @<txp:oui_player />@ tag (vs @<txp:oui_audio />@), the right provider needs to be set if the @play@ value or its field related one is an ID. It is optional, but can fasten the rendering, if the value is an URL.
