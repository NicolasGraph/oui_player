h2. Giphy player

h3. Recognised values for the @play@ attribute

* *ID*;
* http(s)://giphy.com/embed/[*ID*]
* http(s)://giphy.com/gifs/…-[*ID*].

When using the @oui_player@ tag (vs @oui_giphy@), the right provider needs to be set if the @play@ value or its field related one is an ID. It is optional, but can fasten the rendering, if the value is an URL.

h3. Player customization

h4. Size

If the plugin is not able to get a width and height from two of the @width@, @height@ and @ratio@ values, it will try to get the media dimensions defined by the provider through its oEmbed API.
The use of oEmbed API's slow down players rendering, it is strongly recommended to cache the result when using it.
