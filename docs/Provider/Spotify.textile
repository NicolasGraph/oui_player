h3. Recognised values for the @play@ attribute

* *ID*;
* http(s)://open.spotify.com/[*type*]/[*ID*];
* http(s)://play.spotify.com/[*type*]/[*ID*].

h4. Size

If the plugin is not able to get a width and height from two of the @width@, @height@ and @ratio@ values, it will try to get the media dimensions defined by the provider through its oEmbed API.
The use of oEmbed API's slow down players rendering, it is strongly recommended to cache the result when using it.

- @width@ :=
Integer; initially set to @300@.
The width of the player in pixels. =:
- @height@ :=
Integer; initially set to @380@ (@80@ is the usual compact player height value).
The height of the player in pixels. =:
- @ratio@ :=
Integer[@:@]integer; initially not set.
The ratio used to calculate the missing value for the width or the height. =:
- @responsive@ :=
@true@ or @false@; initially set to @false@.
Adapts the final player size from the provided width and/or height and/or ratio values to fit the container width.
