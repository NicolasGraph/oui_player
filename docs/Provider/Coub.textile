h2. Coub player

h3. Recognised values for the @play@ attribute

* *ID*;
* http(s)://coub.com/view/[*ID*];
* http(s)://coub.com/embed/[*ID*].

When using the @oui_player@ tag (vs @oui_coub@), the right provider needs to be set if the @play@ value or its field related one is an ID. It is optional, but can fasten the rendering, if the value is an URL.

h3. Player customization

h4. Size

If the plugin is not able to get a width and height from two of the @width@, @height@ and @ratio@ values, it will try to get the media dimensions defined by the provider through its oEmbed API.
The use of oEmbed API's slow down players rendering, it is strongly recommended to cache the result when using it.

Integer; initially set to @480@.
The width of the player in pixels. =:
- @height@ :=
Integer; initially set to @480@.
The height of the player in pixels. =:
- @ratio@ :=
Integer[@:@]integer; initially not set.
The ratio used to calculate the missing value for the width or the height. =:
- @responsive@ :=
@true@ or @false@; initially set to @false@.
Adapts the final player size from the provided width and/or height and/or ratio values to fit the container width.

h4. Parameters (a→z)

From Txp 4.7, paramaters accepting @true@ and @false@ as valid values can be enable through boolean/valueless attributes.
