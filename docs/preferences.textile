h2. Preferences/options

Plugin prefs can be set under the _Admin > Preferences_ tab and are mainly used as default values for the @<txp:oui_player />@ tag attributes.

- @Providers in use@ :=
Comma separated list of providers in use; set to all by default.
Sorting providers allows to fasten players rendering when the provider is not defined; remove providers you are not using and place the most used ones at first.
The first one will be used by default. =:
- @Display the provider player preferences@ :=
_yes_ or _no_; set to yes by default.
Displays the defined provider related preferences goup. =:

h3. Providers prefs

See each provider related menu item.

While %(information)some player parameters, related to the item to play, should be used through attributes% (e.g. the Youtube @start@ parameter which defines the second where to start playing the video), %(information)these used as global settings should preferrably be set through the plugin preferences% to %(warning)avoid a massive use of tag attributes%.

Of course, it is still possible to override a plugin pref value via an attribute when needed.
