h2. Preferences/options

Plugin prefs can be set under the "Admin > Preferences":?event=prefs#prefs_group_oui_player tab and are mainly used as default values for the @<txp:oui_player />@ tag attributes.

h3. Global prefs

- @Field used by default@ :=
Defines a field to use as the default @play@ attribute value.
%(warning)The provided fieldname must be different than any value entered in it; avoid digits if you use ID's as @play@ attribute values%
*Default:* @article_image@
*valid:* @article_image@, @excerpt@ or any existing custom field =:
- @Favourite provider@ :=
Set the default @provider@ attribute value.
*Default:* the first plugged provider
*valid:* Any plugged provider in the select list =:
- @Render responsive player@ :=
*Default:* no
*valid:* yes or no =:
- @Display the provider player preferences@ :=
Displays the defined provider prefs as a goup of prefs.
*Default:* yes
*valid:* yes or no =:

h3. Providers prefs

While %(information)some player parameters, related to the item to play, should be used through attributes% (e.g. the Youtube @start@ parameter which defines the second where to start playing the video), %(information)these used as global settings should preferrably be set through the plugin preferences% to %(warning)avoid a massive use of tag attributes%.

Of course, it is still possible to override a plugin pref value via an attribute when needed.

h2. Tags

The item to play; *required if* it does not use the value of the custom field selected in the plugin prefs (See each provider to know the valid values).

- @provider@ :=
Extension related provider name; uses the related preference value by default.
The provider to use; *required if* the @play@ attribute is an id, *recommended anyways* if known as it increases the plugin performances by skipping the provider guess. =:

h3. Display a player from manually filled ID

Using the favourite provider set in the prefs.

bc(language-markup). <txp:oui_player play="x4l8awd" />

h3. Display a player only if its URL is recognized as a provider URL scheme

With the default values collected via plugin prefs…

bc(language-markup).. <txp:oui_if_player>
    <txp:oui_player />
</txp:oui_if_player>

p. …or, with a manually filled URL…

bc(language-markup).. <txp:oui_if_player play="https://vimeo.com/155020267">
